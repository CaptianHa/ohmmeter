The TLV5616 D/A converter has 8 pins. 
Pins 1, 2, and 4 connect to PD3, PD0, and PD1 respectively. 
Pins 3 and 5 connect to ground. Pin 6 connects to two 10kΩ resistors that act as a voltage divider going to 5V. 
Pin 8 connects to 5V. Pin 7 on the TLV5616 connects to a 10kΩ resistor that goes to pins 3 and 6 on the LM324N. 
The LM324N has 14 pins.
Pin 3 on the LM324N also connects to another 10kΩ resistor that goes into pin 7. 
Pin 2 connects to two 10kΩ resistors. One resistor goes to ground while the other goes to pin 1. 
Pin 1 also has a 5 kΩ resistor (RB) that goes to pin 5. At pin 5 is another 10kΩ resistor (RL) that connects to ground. Pin 11 connects to ground.
The LM319 has 14 pins.
Pin 3 connects to ground. Pin 4 connects to a 10kΩ and a 2kΩ resistor that goes to ground. 
Pin 11 connects to VBUS (5V) on the TM4C. Pin 12 connects to a 10kΩ resistor that goes to 3.3V (PC4).
